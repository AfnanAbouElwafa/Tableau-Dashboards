I utilized the sample superstore dataset, which contains information about the company's orders and customers. 
The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the store to assess its success. 
I ensured that the dashboards were dynamic and interactive.  

## There are three dashboards: ##
1. Total Orders: This dashboard focuses on displaying store sales, customer statistics, order categories, ship mode, and segments.
2. Orders Returned: This dashboard specifically examines returned orders, delving into the reasons behind these returns by analyzing the country, category, and segment.
3. Details: This dashboard provides more in-depth information for the store.

## KPIs included in the dashboards are: ##
1. Total Sales
2. Total Profit
3. Total Orders
4. Total Customers
5. Profit Margin
6. Categories Distribution
7. Sales/Profit by Year
8. Ship Mode Distribution
9. Sales/Profit Progress Bar
10. Customer Density
11. Orders Returned Distribution
12. Orders Returned by Year/Category/Segment/Ship Mode
13. Sales/Profit Details
