The objective of this dashboard is to gain insights into customer attributes by examining the relationship between revenue and various customer characteristics.

I used the following KPIs:
1. Revenue per Month
2. Revenue per Age
3. Quantity - Discount Correlation
4. Revenue Percentage per Region
5. Revenue per Category
6. Total Revenue
7. Female Revenue
8. Male Revenue
9. Number of Orders
